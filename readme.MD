# Git tutorial

There are numerous git tutorials out there already, so why create another one? Basically this tutorial is a way for me to extract and test all the knowledge I have about git and merge it with GitHub so that other people, mostly from IQuality, can share this knowledge with me.

This article is not about source control ing eneral. I will not focus on propper project management whilst using a SCMS; but this articel is about how to technically use git in small to large projects. I will address merging, cloning and GitHub and I'll try and focus on the technical issues and choices you must make.

## git init
t all starts with the command ```git init```. This command initializes a git database in a local directory on your computer. Imagine that the ```~``` sign in a path means your personal directory in your preferred OS. Now imagine, if you are running on Windows that you've created an alias for the ```dir``` command called ```ls``` and now we are good to go.
